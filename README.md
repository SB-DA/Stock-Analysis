# Stock-Analysis
Exploring Green Energy Stock Performance by analyzing Financial Data using VBA

## Background
We helped steve analyse a handful of green energy stocks to addition to DAQO stocks where his parents were planning to invest their money. Steve loved the workbook we prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. 

Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although our code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that we did in this module. Then, we will determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster.
